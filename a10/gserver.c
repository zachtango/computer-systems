/*
 * read dictionary file to array of words & get ready to play the hangman!
if you are using fgets() to read the word
	  cptr = strchr(line, '\n');
	  if (cptr)
	  	*cptr = '\0';
 However, since we are dealing with words, you can use fscanf(...,"%s", ...) instead!

 * wait for a request to come in (client specifies unique pipename)
 * select a random word using rand()
 * fork() to create a child to handle this client! (dedicated server process for that client)
 * fork() enables games to proceed in parallel. Parent returns to wait for new client requests
 * respond with another unique server-side pipename 
 *
 * send a bunch of stars (indicating the word length)
 * for each guess the client sends in, respond with a message 
 * and send updated display word.
 *
 * Whenever you send strings through named pipes, 
 * terminate with '\n' and also do fflush() for that data to make it to other side without getting stuck
 * in buffers.
 *
 * open public fifo
 * while (fgets()) {
 * }
 *
